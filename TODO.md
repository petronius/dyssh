# To-do list

* Timeout for command executions in non-interactive mode
* `:flush` for clearing all past history. A better way of
* `:write` for writing logs from the interactive session; implement logs from
  non-interactive sessions
* Clean up `(dyssh)`-tagged outputs.
* Some kind of command for looking at command outputs older than the most
  recent.
* Configuration file format that doesn't require section headers.
* Storing and reverting back to lists in the current session (eg., to fix errors
  on a subset of hosts)
* `:hide <h|all>` and `:show <h|all>` and `:focus <h>` for temporarily ignoring
  certain hosts.

* Python 3 compatability?
* better alignment with SSH command line arguments
* make sure custom keyfiles are supported
* better support for passwords
* seperate host configuration files
